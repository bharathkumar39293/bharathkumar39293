## About me

- Full-stack developer with hands-on experience in **React, Node.js, Express, MongoDB**
- Actively contributing to **open-source projects**, primarily **Rocket.Chat**
- Currently deepening skills in **Next.js and TypeScript**
- Goal-oriented: **GSoC → long-term remote role**

I care more about **understanding systems and codebases** than just building demos.

  - Exploring codebase, fixing issues, and understanding large-scale real-time systems
